# Todo Backlog Draft

- crates.io and github/ripissue: add owners
- [ ] make a professional README
  - link to crates.io
  - basic usage (simple, just as `bug`)
  - increment usage with minimal single workflow (with branches)
  - more: mgmt repo and sprints
  - directories tree
  - full team workflow
  - release workflow
    - tag workflow: how it works with annotated tags...
- [ ] automatic identify issue from branch
  - if in branch `I-my_issue_id`, command `ripi issue commit` auto identifies id
- [ ] implement tests (unit + integration)
- [ ] `ripi <elem> list`: increment print layout for cmd list: show issues properties to stdout (status, tags, etc...)
