# Todo Backlog Draft

- ripissue:
  - automatic create branch
  - phase close: 1) commit, then add again and close (to pass pre-commit)
  - automatic delete branch when closing issue
  - condition git commit only with ripi issue

-   [ ] implement tests (unit + integration)
-   [ ] `ripi create` automatically creates a branch too?
    -   check if curr branch is `develop`
    -   branch-name == issue/sprint/epic/initiative id
