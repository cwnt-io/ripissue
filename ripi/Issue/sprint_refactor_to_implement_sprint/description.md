# sprint_refactor_to_implement_sprint (Issue)

<!-- toc GFM -->

* [Comments](#comments)

<!-- toc -->

- [ ] refactor app to be composable
    - [ ] flatten to args to make this api work â†´
        ```sh
        ripi sprint create [due-date] # validate iso-date for name
        ripi sprint add-issue --repo repo_name --issue issue_name
        ripi sprint remove-issue --repo repo_name --issue issue_name
        ```

- [x] setup my (gubasso's) rustfmt in nvim
